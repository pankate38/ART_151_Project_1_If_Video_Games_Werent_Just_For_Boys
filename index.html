      <h1> SOME CHARACTERS YOU CAN PLAY INCLUDE... </h1> 
      <h2> Cloud Strife </h2><img src = "media/images/cloud.png"> <p>Cloud Strife wields large broadswords in battle, including the iconic Buster Sword, and is a versatile melee combatant. Cloud has the best all-around stats. He develops compassion for the planet and the people he fights to protect from the Shinra Electric Power Company and his nemesis, Sephiroth. </p>
      <h2> Tifa Lockhart </h2><img style = "display: block; width: 150px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src = "media/images/tifa.png"> <p>In contrast to her shy personality, Tifa has a vigorous combat style, typically fighting at close range with her fists. She uses martial arts skills to fight opponents, and equips knuckles as her weapons.</p>
      <h2> Aerith Gainsborough </h2> <img src = "media/images/aerith.png"> <p>Aerith wields staves in battle, and is in the back row by default, as she primarily uses magic from equipped Materia in battle. Her Limit abilities are defensive, either providing restorative powers, healing other party members, or bestowing status enhancements.</p>
      <h2> Barret Wallace </h2> <img src = "media/images/barret.png"> <p>Barret wields a gun-arm, a mechanical gun grafted in place of his right arm, allowing him to fire from range. He is the leader of a cell of the eco-terrorist group Avalanche, trying to prevent Shinra Electric Power Company from using mako, the life source of the planet, as a form of energy.</p>
