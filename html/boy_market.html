      <h1> SOME CHARACTERS YOU CAN PLAY INCLUDE... </h1>
      <h2> Cloud Strife </h2><img src = "../media/images/cloud.png"><p> An arrogant and proud swordsman at first, Cloud introduces himself to Avalanche as a former member of an elite warrior unit called SOLDIER who has turned mercenary, and uninterested in anything beyond his hired task at hand. He develops compassion for the planet and the people he fights to protect from the Shinra Electric Power Company and his nemesis, Sephiroth. </p>
      <h2> Cid Highwind </h2><img style = "display: block; width: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src = "../media/images/cid.webp"> <p> Cid is a former Shinra engineer and rocket scientist who has an unfulfilled dream of sending a rocket to space. Cid mistrusts the company, and when one of its executives attempt to steal his plane, the Tiny Bronco, he joins Cloud and his allies to fight Shinra. Cid is the most uncouth of the protagonists: he swears constantly, is short-tempered, cranky and impatient, and chain-smokes cigarettes. </p>
      <h2> Barret Wallace </h2><img src = "../media/images/barret.png"> <p>Barret fights passionately for his cause to protect the planet. He cares greatly for his allies, motivating them with powerful speeches, while also himself fighting on the front lines of his cell's operations. Barret wields a gun-arm, a mechanical gun grafted in place of his right arm, allowing him to fire from range.</p>
      <h2> Sephiroth </h2><img src = "../media/images/sephiroth.png"> <p>Before his fall from grace, Sephiroth was one of the most lauded success stories of the Shinra Electric Power Company's SOLDIER program. His successes in the field of battle during the conflicts surrounding Shinra's bid for global domination led to his status as a celebrity war hero and the poster boy for both SOLDIER and the Shinra military as a whole. Later driven insane after discovering the unnatural circumstances of his creation, Sephiroth developed delusions of godhood and a misanthropic ambition to destroy the planet.</p>
