      <h1> SOME CHARACTERS YOU CAN PLAY INCLUDE... </h1>
      <h2> Cloud Strife </h2><img style = "display: block; width: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src = "../media/images/cloud.png"><p> Beneath his hardened outer persona is a softer, more caring individual who simply struggles to open up, but is striving to be a hero. Cloud later discovers more about his past and, with the help of his friends, learns there is more to being a hero than possessing physical strength and fame.</p>
      <h2> Tifa Lockhart </h2><img style = "display: block; width: 150px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src = "../media/images/tifa.png"><p>Tifa is reserved, moral, and empathic, acting as a motherly figure towards her allies when providing encouragement and emotional support. She also serves as the voice of reason grounding them to think things through and do the right thing.</p>
      <h2> Aerith Gainsborough </h2> <img src = "../media/images/aerith.png"> <p>Aerith is the last of the Cetra, an ancient race with powerful magical abilities, and so the Shinra Electric Power Company hunts her throughout her life, seeking to exploit her powers. She meets Cloud Strife in Midgar, and the two become close, leading her to join his quest to fight Shinra and hunt down Sephiroth. Aerith is upbeat, carefree, and joyful, being flirtatious towards Cloud and compassionate towards others.</p>
      <h2> Cait Sith </h2> <img  style = "display: block; width: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src = "../media/images/cait.webp"> <p>Cait Sith rides on the back of a huge stuffed Mog he magically brought to life. Megaphone in hand, he's always shouting orders and creating dopey attacks. </p>
