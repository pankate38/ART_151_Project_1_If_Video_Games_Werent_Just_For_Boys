      <p class = "infoText"> 
        Midgar is the most technologically advanced city on the planet. Its large circular structure is supported 
        above the ground by eight mako reactors and a central pillar, with various other supports around the city. 
        On top of the structure lies the city proper, divided into eight sectors, while underneath it lie the slums 
        for the city's unfortunate and downtrodden. Midgar was once eight individual towns, but their names have 
        been forgotten in favor of referring to the different areas as sectors. <br><br>
        
        Thanks to its eight mako reactors, the city's massive power demands are met, but at a cost to the surrounding 
        countryside, which has become a barren wasteland due to the city sapping the surrounding life energy. 
        Due to this, the city and its reactors are a prime target for terrorism/rebel groups like Avalanche who seek 
        to restore the planet to its former state and stop Shinra from sapping its life energy.<br></p>

      <p class = "infoText"> The Grasslands begins where the extent of wasteland caused by Midgar's Mako extraction ends. 
        Set up in the otherwise empty plains of the Grasslands Area is the Chocobo Farm owned by Choco Bill, who has made business out of running an inn and selling 
        Chocobos and Chocobo Lure Materia to travelers trying to cross the marsh. <br> <br> The Chocobo Farm is located in the 
        northeast area of the eastern continent. It is situated in the middle of grassland with an abundance of chocobos 
        roaming the land nearby. The farm itself is relatively small, with a single ranch, an outside pen, and a house for 
        the owner.</p>

      <img src = "../media/images/gold_welcome.gif">
      <p class = "infoText"> The Gold Saucer is located in the midst of a desert to the southeast of the planet's western continent. 
        A towering amusement park built over the ruins of Old Corel, it is a world famous tourist attraction. 
        The Gold Saucer is notable for being home to a number of minigames, particularly at the Battle Square and 
        Chocobo Square. It is divided into seven attractions, which we'll leave it for you to explore and uses GP or Gold Points as its own currency, 
        which can only be won from its minigames. <br><br> 
        The Gold Saucer's attractions are situated entirely on discs held up by the structure itself. The discs appear to reach high above ground level, as clouds 
        can be seen from the Saucer's exterior. Directly below it is Corel Prison, the remains of the old town of Corel.
        The proximity of the Gold Saucer to <a class = "costaLink" href = "#costaInfo">Costa del Sol</a>, located to its northeast, leads many tourists landing at <a class = "costaLink" href = "#costaInfo"> Costa del Sol </a> to go onto visit the Gold Saucer.</p>

      <img src = "../media/images/beach.jfif">
      <p class = "infoText">  It is a coastal resort town with sunny climate all year round. The town is largely built around its tourism industry, 
        but also serves as the main port on the western continent for the Shinra Electric Power Company, a shipping route connecting it to Junon on 
        the eastern continent.<br> Further down, you can explore the deep oceans around Junon using a submarine! This area is also known as the Bottom of the Sea.</p>

      <p class = "infoText"> Up North near the mountains lies the Icicle Area. There are many areas to explore here including the Bone Village, the Sleeping Forest and the Icicle Inn. The year-round cold temperatures are not due to the location, which is somewhat polar, but because of the town's proximity to the North Crater, where the planet uses a large amount of spirit energy to try to heal itself. As a result of the year-round temperatures, the village serves as a tourist resort, with some tourists hailing from Costa del Sol for snowboarding. </p>

The village is located atop a river within a vast forest, and located near the large Da-chao Mountain, on which the Da-chao Statue is built. The pagoda, known as the Pagoda of the Five Mighty Gods for the gods of Power, Speed, Magic, War, and Omni, is located in the north end of town.
        <br><br>The village architecture, resembles Japanese architecture, namely that seen in Itsukushima. This is seen in the bright red, wooden buildings, as well as the tiered pagoda building, and the bridges used to connect buildings situated over water in the south part of town.
