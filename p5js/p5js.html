      <p class = "infoText">Midgar is the capital city and power base of the Shinra Electric Power Company in the world of Gaia. <br><br> 
        Midgar is the most technologically advanced city on the planet. Its large circular structure is supported 
        above the ground by eight mako reactors and a central pillar, with various other supports around the city. 
        On top of the structure lies the city proper, divided into eight sectors, while underneath it lie the slums 
        for the city's unfortunate and downtrodden. Midgar was once eight individual towns, but their names have 
        been forgotten in favor of referring to the different areas as sectors. <br><br>
        
        Thanks to its eight mako reactors, the city's massive power demands are met, but at a cost to the surrounding 
        countryside, which has become a barren wasteland due to the city sapping the surrounding life energy. 
        Due to this, the city and its reactors are a prime target for terrorism/rebel groups like Avalanche who seek 
        to restore the planet to its former state and stop Shinra from sapping its life energy.<br></p>
